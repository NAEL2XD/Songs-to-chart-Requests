# Welcome to nael2xd's github song request

You may request any songs that you want, even if it's spammy, or something you'd like, it'll also be on my mod called [NUSM](https://gamejolt.com/games/NUSM/886661)

### Rules
1. Give me the song name and the user that made the song (links is faster).
2. The song must not be overrated.
3. The BPM must be shown, even if it's on video or description.
4. If the original composer has their channel hidden/deleted, i will not chart that UNLESS you know who is the og user composer.
5. If there's only 1 part and it is a massive bpm, it would not be allowed.
6. If the song is more than 10 minutes long, i will not chart it.
