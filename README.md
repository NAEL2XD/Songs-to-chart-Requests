# Welcome to nael2xd's github song request

You may request any songs that you want, even if it's spammy, or something you'd like, it'll also be on my mod called Nael's Revamped Spamming Mod!

# Rules:
1. Your request should be properly filled (include credits, bpms and such.)
2. Songs that either has the vocals so quiet or is confusing will be rejected unless the flp is given.

   - DOUBLE CHECK if it's actually an "**Request a song.**" issue, you can check in the top left.
3. On the "New Issue" Tab, Make the title the song and the composer (or composer), Example: REVEALED by Archasia.
4. On the "Link to the song." box, Make sure you find the link (such as https://youtu.be/) that matches the same as you've set in the title.
5. At the BPM Part, just set the bpm in numbers, it could be shown at the video, comments or description!
6. If everything is filled, press the "**Submit new issue**" box, it should take you 5 second to create it.
