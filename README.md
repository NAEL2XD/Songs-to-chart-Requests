# Welcome to nael2xd's github song request

You may request any songs that you want, even if it's spammy, or something you'd like, it'll also be on my mod called [Nael's Ultimate Spamming Mod!](https://gamejolt.com/games/NUSM/886661)

### Rules
In this category i have set up some rules for users that wants these songs charted since viewers wants me to, but some viewers may not read them which makes them confused on why there are rules here.

Here are the rules:
1. If the original composer has their channel hidden/deleted, i will not chart that UNLESS you know who is the og user composer.
2. If there's only 1 part and it is a massive bpm or repeated part, i will not chart it.
   - basically if the song name is ŒØ∆§ÂçÑÂçÇ≈£ùïôÔº© ùï™ùîºùêçùê†ÔºØ‚Ñïùê® then it would not be accepted as it contains massive bpm part and does not contain any normal bpm (break parts does not count)
3. If the song is more than 10 minutes long, i will not chart it. (unless it is actually fun)
4. If you spam the same issue, there's 0.001% chance it'll get charted.
5. If the track notes is confusing, i won't chart it. (unless i have the flp and can [sniff](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/SNIFF) it).
   - I can try but i don't even know how to.
6. If the song is extremely loud [like this](https://youtu.be/mU8uIofYGXk), then there is no way i will chart that without my ear getting earbleeded.
   - basically if the song name contains ear rape then i'm not allowing it.
   - this also applies for any loud hypertone things
7. If the original composer refuses to make me chart the song, then i won't.
8. DOUBLE Check if the song that you've requested was not charted before.
